### Responsibilities:
* Developing control and guidance algorithms for a fixed-wing UAV (26kg MTOM).
* Developing and analyzing the control performance in Matlab/Simulink using control stability criteria.
* Performing model identification of the airplane by inputting pre-defined signals and analyzing outputs to estimate the model. Based on this model, parameters for PID controllers are estimated and finely tuned by real flight tests.
* Developing control algorithms for autonomously taking-off on the runway.

### Results:
* Successfully deploying an autopilot software on an FPGA-based hardware (using FPGA Cyclone Altera).
* Satisfactory control performance verified by numerous autonomous flights.
