### Responsibilities:
* Creating a robot urdf model in a simulator (MuJoCo) and perform training using Deep Deterministic Policy (DDPG) and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)
* Using a mechanism called Experience Ranking to rank training experiences and allow high scored training experiences to be used for training the control policy. Outperformed HER in learning performance.
* Implementing in the training in the real robot

### Results:
* Successfully training the robot to with four different robotic environments in OpenAI Gym & MuJoCo.
* Implementing the training with the real robot.
